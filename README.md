# bazookoids
> A mobile-optimised Android release is [available here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kristianseng.bazookoids). Take a look at [this project](https://github.com/george7378/basic-physics) for a simpler example of the physics engine.

Bazookoids is a basic demo of a simple split-screen two player game which includes a custom rigid body physics model. The object of the game is to flip your opponent over by ramming them. There are multiple physical interactions modelled between the arena and the two vehicles.

Player one (red vehicle) can move using **WASD**, and can change the camera view using **C**. Player two (yellow vehicle) can move using the **Arrow keys**, and can change the camera view using **N**. Pressing **Space** will reset the game with the vehicles in random starting positions. Have fun!
