# bazookoids
> Take a look at [this project](https://github.com/george7378/basic-physics) for a further example of the physics engine used here.

Bazookoids is a basic demo of a simple split-screen two player game which includes a custom rigid body physics model. The object of the game is to flip your opponent over by ramming them. There are multiple physical interactions modelled between the arena and the two vehicles.

Player one (red vehicle) can move using **WASD**, and can change the camera view using **C**. Player two (yellow vehicle) can move using the **Arrow keys**, and can change the camera view using **N**. Have fun!
